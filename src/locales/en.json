Using JavaScript, it selects necessary DOM elements to dynamically display advice, fetched asynchronously from the https://api.adviceslip.com/advice API. A dice button triggers updates, bringing fresh advice on click, while CSS and Google Fonts ensure a stylish and readable interface. This setup illustrates a responsive, user-interactive web application.",

The app consists of a container with two buttons: one to request a joke and another to navigate to an 'About' page. When the user clicks the 'Tell me a joke!' button, an asynchronous JavaScript function fetches a joke from the JokeAPI, ensuring it's safe for all audiences by excluding NSFW, racist, sexist, and explicit content. The fetched joke is then rendered in the HTML div with the id 'speech' and read aloud using the VoiceRSS API. Additionally, clicking the 'About app' button redirects the user to an about page.",

The main functionality includes displaying todos, allowing users to add, edit, and delete todos, and marking todos as completed. The app utilizes React state hooks such as useState to manage todo data and modal visibility. It consists of components like MyTodos, Modal, and CreateTaskForm, which handle different aspects of the todo management. The MyTodos component renders the list of todos, allowing users to interact with them. The Modal component handles the display of a modal for adding or editing todos. Finally, the CreateTaskForm component provides a form for adding or editing todos, with form validation ensuring that users input data into form fields before submissions or edits can proceed. This validation enhances user experience by prompting them to provide essential information, such as the title of the todo, before proceeding. The App component integrates these components and manages state and event handling for the todo functionality.",
